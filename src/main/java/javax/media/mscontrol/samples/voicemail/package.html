<P>This package contains a simple voicemail application.</P>
<P>The starting point is <A HREF="../../www/samples/voicemail/VoiceMailServlet.java"><B>VoiceMailServlet.java</B></A>
, which is the SIP Servlet interfacing.<BR>Based on the caller's
identity, one version of the dialog is selected:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P><A HREF="../../www/samples/voicemail/CoreMailSession.java"><B>CoreMailSession.java</B></A>
	is a simple user-interaction dialog, using DTMF patterns and
	messages defined by core objects.<BR>The callers are required to
	enter a PIN code, and can leave messages, or read messages that were
	deposited previously.<BR>CoreMailbox.java and CoreMailboxMgr.java
	are ancillary classes, not JSR309-related.</P>
	<LI><P><A HREF="../../www/samples/voicemail/VxmlMailSession.java"><B>VxmlMailSession.java</B></A>
	shows how to launch a vxml interpreter to handle the
	user-interaction. The vxml script is<BR>fetched on an http server;
	the script itself is not included, and so the service is not further
	described.</P>
</UL>
<P>The remaing file, <A HREF="../../www/samples/voicemail/VoiceMailSession.java">VoiceMailSession.java</A>,
is a common part to the two previous ones. It contains the
management<BR>of the NetworkConnection, which is same in both cases.</P>
